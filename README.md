# Age-Calculator

1. The project is written in Java.
2. It is a Netbeans project. Also an executable .jar is available.
3. Double click the .jar file and run the file.
4. Input the birthdate and click calculate. It will show you your age. You don't need to enter the current date. The program will take it from the system itself.
5. Exceptions are also handeled. So it won't crash.
